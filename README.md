# MS Thesis: Characterization of Regular Local Rings

This repository contains materials related to my Master’s Thesis in Mathematics, which focuses on two foundational theorems in commutative algebra:

- **Serre's Characterization of Regular Local Rings**  
  A Noetherian local ring is regular if and only if it has **finite global dimension**. Furthermore, in this case, the global dimension equals the **Krull dimension**.

- **Regular Local Rings are UFDs**  
  Every regular local ring is a **unique factorization domain (UFD)**.

The thesis explores the concept of dimension from both **homological** and **ring-theoretic** perspectives. The key results are proved using tools and theorems from **commutative algebra** and **homological algebra**.

## Disclaimer

The proofs presented in this thesis are **not original work**. All appropriate references are cited in the full report.
