My Masters' Thesis explores two foundational theorems in commutative algebra:

- **Serre's Characterization of Regular Local Rings**: A Noetherian local ring is regular if and only if it has finite global dimension. Moreover, in this case, the global dimension equals the Krull dimension.

- **Regular Local Rings are UFDs**: Every regular local ring is a unique factorization domain (UFD).

I studied key properties of regular local rings and the notion of dimension from both the homological and ring-theoretic perspectives. The theorems are proved using tools and results from commutative algebra and homological algebra. 

Note: The proofs are not original work. Appropriate references have been provided in the report.
