The two main theorems of this thesis are Serre's characterization of regular local
rings, which says that a Noetherian local ring is regular if and only if its global
dimension is nite and in that case global dimension and Krull dimension are equal;
the second theorem says that any regular local ring is a unique factorization domain.
We study notion of dimension from both homological algebraic and ring theoretic
perspective, and properties of a regular local ring. We nally prove the theorems
using results from commutative algebra and homological algebra.
